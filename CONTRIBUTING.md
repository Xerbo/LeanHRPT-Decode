# How To Contribute

Thanks for showing an interest in improving LeanHRPT, these guidelines outline how you should go about contributing to the project.

## Did you find a bug?

1. Make sure the bug has not already been reported.
2. If an issue already exists, leave a "Thumbs Up" in order to show your interest
3. If an issue doesn't exist, open a new one with a clear title and description and, if relevant, any files that cause the behaviour

## Do you have a patch that fixes a bug/adds a feature?

1. Fork this repository and put your changes on a *new branch*.
2. Make sure to use sensible commit names (no "Oops" commits)
3. Open a new pull request into master.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can email me the patch at `xerbo (at) protonmail (dot) com`

## Coding style

- Use LF line endings
- Whitespace should be denoted with spaces
- Prefer readable code to fast code
- If you're making large changes, discuss it before creating a PR

## Commit message style

- Keep titles short to prevent wrapping (descriptions exist)
- Split up large changes into multiple commits
- Never use hastags for sequential counting in commits, as this interferes with issue/PR referencing
