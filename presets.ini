# LeanHRPT preset definition file
#
#  It is formatted as ini and parsed by inipp (https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/inipp)
#  meaning that features like variables are supported.
#
#  Entries must have a description, category, author, satellites and expression field
#  in order to be parsed, entries without these will simply be ignored.
#

# Presets for uncalibrated imagers will not function reliably over multiple files;
# MSU-MR, MTVZA, HIRS, MHS

# Basic composites
# (same can be replicated with GUI compositor)
